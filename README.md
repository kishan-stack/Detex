A basic python script to automate the detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities from a list of URLs  provided. The script utilized various techniques, including payload  injection and pattern matching, to identify potential security  weaknesses in web applications.


SQL injection is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate an application's SQL query through user input. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and even complete system compromise. Detecting SQL injection is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of databases.
